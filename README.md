# Python-Data-Science-and-Git-Analysis
This project showcases basic Data Science principles in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib. 

Questions 17 through 24 analyze a dataset about household computer use in th US from 2013-2018. This is done by iterating through the dataset and creating a dictionary, where the key is the year and the value is a pandas DataFrame that corresponds to the CSV for that year. Matplotlib is used here to display trends and relationships in the dataset.

Questions 25 through 32 analyze the changes made to a git project over time. There are also measurements done that record the amount of time certain Pandas operations take.
